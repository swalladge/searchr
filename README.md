# Local Search

A simple command line search engine for your local plain text files.

Work in progress! The code is littered with TODO's, everything is hardcoded,
and not much is implemented yet. Use at own risk!

## Installation

Standard rust project. `cargo install` or git clone and `cargo build` should
work fine.


## Usage

1. create a config file to configure what files you want indexed and where to
   store the indexes
2. index: `local-search -a index`
3. search: `local-search search "foo bar"


## Configuration

TODO


## Notes

- builds indexes and searches with [tantivy](https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy). This also means that other tantivy-based tools can be used on the indexes, like [tantivy-cli](https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy-cli).

## Why?

My note taking workflow involves a large number of plain text files loosely
inspired by
[Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/)
and [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki).
Since I generally avoid categories and hierarchies, various types of searches
is the main method I use for finding a note. Currently there are two methods I
use for finding a note:

1. fuzzy text search on the note filenames (Fzf or [this
   script](https://github.com/swalladge/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/open-wiki-page)
2. grep through the files

The first method is perfect if I roughly know what what I'm looking for and
know there's a note with that in the title. The second is great if I'm looking
for a specific pattern or word. What's missing though is a general full text
content search.  Grepping doesn't work so well when you're looking for a set of
keywords. So that's where this tool comes in! Now I have a third method for
searching my notes that sits between a fuzzy title search and specific regex
searches.

There are other full text search engines around, but so far I haven't found
something that is small and simple. I wanted something that I could configure
and set up by nothing more than editing a short config file and running a
single command.
